# alig
Put everything (issues, pull requests, wikies, kanban boards, ...) about your project into git repository.

# Why?
## Everything version controlled
History of whole project is in your git repository.
## Everything is in one place
Never lost anything.
## Go for decentralized git
Not need for github anymore
